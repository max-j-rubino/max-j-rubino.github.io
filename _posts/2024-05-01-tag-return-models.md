title: "Tag return models"

Tag return studies are an excellent way to study fish populations. Tag return studies often use external tags to illicit angler reporting of captures, internal tags to indicate survial, or both. In this post I demonstrate different hypothetical case studies and analysis using the program NIMBLE. 


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
